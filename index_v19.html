					<h5 class="w3-center"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">HOW DOES IT WORK?</span></h5><!--Sub Headings-->
					<p>A nuclear reactor produces electricity in much the same way other power plants do. The chain reaction produces the energy, which turns water into steam. The pressure of the steam turns a generator, which produces electricity.</p>
					<p>The distinction is in however the heat is made. A Power plant that runs on fossil fuels burns coal, oil or natural gas to get heat. During an nuclear energy plants process, heat is created from the splitting of atoms – a process referred to as fission.</p>
					<ul class="listStyle"><!--List-->
						<li>Nuclear reactor creates heat that is used to make steam.<br></li>
						<li>The steam turns a turbine connected to an electromagnet, called a generator.<br></li>
						<li>The generator produces electricity.</li>
					</ul><br>
					<p>In a Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) – high pressure prevents water in the reactor vessel from boiling. The super-heated water is carried to a steam generator, which is made up of many small pipes. The heat in these pipes is used to turn a second, isolated, supply of water to steam, which is in turn used to drive the turbine. The water from the reactor is pumped back into the reactor vessel and reheated. The steam from the turbine is cooled in a condenser and the resulting water is sent back to the steam generator.</p>

					<p>Enriched uranium is the fuel for nuclear reactors. Uranium is an abundant, naturally radioactive element found in most rocks. As uranium breaks down or decays, it produces heat inside the Earth’s crust. A similar process generates heat inside a nuclear reactor.</p>

					<p>Fission is the process of splitting a nucleus in two.</p>
					<p>Inside each uranium fuel pellet, there are millions of uranium nuclei. When these nuclei are split, a huge amount of energy is released. Some of this energy is from radiation, but the biggest source is kinetic energy. This is the energy that produces heat inside a reactor, which in turn is used to generate steam, and ultimately creates electricity.</p>

					<h5 class="w3-center"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">How Does a Nuclear Energy Plant Generate Electricity?</span></h5><!--Sub Headings-->
					<p>The nuclear chain reaction produces heat inside the reactor vessel and heats water to a very high temperature. Due to pressure inside the system, the water does not boil.</p>
					<p>This hot, pressurized water flows through thousands of looped pipes, while a second stream of water flows around the outside of the pipes inside the steam generator. This water is under less pressure, so the heat from the pipes boils it into steam.</p>
					<p>The steam travels through pipes to turbines and spins their blades. The turbines’ blades spin the turbine shaft, which connects to a generator. The generator shaft rotates around inside a set of magnets. This creates electrical current.</p>

					<p>In a nuclear power plant, the nuclear chain reaction takes place within the reactor vessel. Operators rigorously manage the chain reaction within the apparatus in many ways.</p>
					<ul class="listStyle"><!--List-->
						<li>The fuel type and the way the reactor core is organized changes depending on what quantity of nuclear fission happens.<br></li>
						<li>The use of a moderator (light water, deuterium oxide or graphite) slows down neutrons. Most Plants use light-weight water as a moderator – one among the foremost common technologies used round the world for many years.<br></li>
						<li>Control rods are a product made of material like the boron element that absorb neutrons, that stops them from splitting more uranium atoms. Raising the rods speeds up the chain reaction and lowering them slows or in some cases stop it.</li>
					</ul><br>
					<p>Reactor operators will increase the speed of fission to get additional heat, or decrease the speed of fission to get less heat. They use this method to regulate the electrical output of the energy plant.</p>

					<p>In 2013 a study conducted by NASA found that nuclear energy has prevented around 1.8 million deaths if you include the death tolls from Chernobyl and Fukushima, nuclear energy ranks last in deaths per energy unit produced.</p>
					<p>While nuclear waste is toxic, it's usually stored somewhere, while the noxious by-products of fossil fuels get pumped into the air. So just by reducing the number of fossil fuels burned countless cases of cancer, lung disease and accidents in coal mines are avoided. If we can choose between lots of dangerous stuff being put into a deep hole and lots and lots and lots of dangerous stuff being pumped into the atmosphere, the former seems more logical.</p>
					<p>Nuclear energy feels way more dangerous though. Single catastrophic events burn into our memory, while coal and oil kill silently. It's like the death rate of flying versus driving. Nuclear energy will save more lives than it destroys.</p></div>

					<h5 class="w3-center"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Nuclear Energy Reduces Co2 Emissions</span></h5><!--Sub Headings-->
					<p>Nuclear energy is arguably less harmful to the environment in terms of climate change than fossil fuels, the world's main source of energy since 1976.</p>
					<p>About 64 Gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions have not been pumped out thanks to nuclear energy and by the mid 21st century that could amount to an additional 80 to 240 Gigatons.</p>
					<p>Humanity's energy consumption is rising steadily, according to the US government projections China alone will add the equivalent of a new 600-megawatt coal plant every 10 days for the next 10 years. China already burns 4 billion tons of coal each year. Coal is cheap, relatively abundant and is readily available, so it's not likely that humanity will stop using it.</p>
					<p>Nuclear energy might be the only way of dampening the effects of climate change and preventing a catastrophic man-made global warming. Compared to the other things we do nuclear energy is relatively clean so even if it is a good idea to quit nuclear energy long term it might be a good solution for the next hundred years or so compared to the alternatives.</p></div>

					<p>Maybe technology will solve the problem of nuclear waste and dangerous power plants the nuclear reactors we've used so far are mostly outdated technology because nuclear innovation stopped in the 1970s.</p>
					<p>There are models like the thorium reactor that could solve the problem altogether. Thorium is abundant, hard to turn into nuclear weapons and up to two orders of magnitude less wasteful than current nuclear reactors. The waste material might also be only dangerous for a few hundred years in contrast to a couple of thousand years. One ton of thorium is estimated to provide the same amount of energy as 200 tons of uranium or 3.5 million tons of coal.</p>
					<p>While we cannot know for sure if an alternative nuclear technology will keep its promises, shouldn't we at least do more research before we forego an opportunity to solve lots of humanity's current problems?</p></div>

					<h5 class="w3-center"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Thorium-based Nuclear Energy</span></h5><!--Sub Headings-->
					<p>Thorium (Th-232) itself is not fissile so is not directly usable in thermal baryon reactors. However, it's ‘fertile’ and upon absorbing a neutron it will transmute to uranium-233 (U-233) which is fissile and can be used as fuel material. Thorium reaction, in this case, is much like the uranium reaction which creates plutonium-239. Therefore you require that Th-232 from the beginning is irradiated in a reactor to provide the desired neutron dosing to produce protactinium-233. The Pa-233 that is created can either be chemically separated from the parent Thorium fuel and additionally the decay product of U-233 can then be recycled into new fuel.</p>
					<p>Thorium fuels, therefore, need a fissile material as a ‘driver’ that can produce an excess of neutrons to maintain a chain reaction. The only fissile drivers are U-233, U-235 or Pu-239. (None of these is easy to supply)</p>
					<p>However, it may be possible to design Thorium fuels that manufacture heaps of U-233 in thermal reactors than the fissile material they consume (fissile conversion ratio of more than 1.0 and is also called breeding). Thermal breeding with Thorium elements requires, again, an excess of neutron particles in the baryon/neutron economy (i.e., there ought to be low neutron loss through escape). The possibility to breed fissile material in slow neutron systems is only a feature of Thorium-based fuels and not possible with Uranium fuels.</p></div>

					<h5 class="w3-center"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Nuclear Proliferation</span></h5><!--Sub Headings-->
					<p>Nuclear technology made a violet entrance onto the world stage. Just one year after the world's first-ever nuclear weapons test in 1944, two large japanese cities known as Hiroshima and Nagasaki were destroyed by two single bombs. After this reactor technology slowly evovled as a means of generating electricity but it has always been intimately connected with nuclear weapons technology, it's almost impossible to develop nuclear weapons without access weapons technology and the worlds superpowers know this.</p> 
					<p>In New Zealands case the use of reactor technology may not lead the Goverment to devlop nuclear weapons but the possiblity is a theart to other countries as we are an isolated country compared to others putting New Zealand at risk of nuclear dominance. In fact the nuclear non-proliferation treaty serves the purpose of spreaing nuclear reactor technology without spreading nuclear weapons, this however has limited success.</p>
					<p>In forty years, five countries have developed their weapons with the help of reactor technology. The fact of the matter is that it can be extremely difficult to distinguish a covert nuclear weapons program from the peaceful use of nuclear energy via reactors.</p>
					<p>In the nineteen seventies the big nuclear powers were happily selling peaceful technology to smaller countries which then developed weapons of their own. The road to deadly nuclear weapons is always paved with peaceful reactors.</p>
					<p>If ever need be our goverment at this time could not combat this new found threat.</p>

					<p>In 1957, 1987 and 2011 large areas of land in Russia Ukraine and Japan were rendered unfit for human habitation for decades to come, the number of deaths is highly disputed but probably lies in the thousands these disasters happened with nuclear reactors of very different types in very different countries and several decades apart.</p>
					<ul class="listStyle"><!--List-->
						<h6>2011, Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant:</h6>
						<li>11 March, 70km off the east coast of Japan an earthquake hits with a magnitude scale of 9 (For comparison sakes, a ten kiloton nuclear explosion roughly produces a seismic wave of moment magnitude of 4.8).<br></li>
						<li>12 March, explosion and radiation leak at unit 1.<br></li>
						<li>13 March, seawater injected into unit 1 and 3.<br></li>
						<li>14 March, explosions at unit 3 and seawater injected into unit 2.<br></li>
						<li>15 March, explosions at unit 2, fire and explosion at unit 4.<br></li>
						<li>16 December, all reactors are in a state of “cold shutdown”.</li>
					</ul><br>
					<p>The unit reactors were injected with seawater doped with neutron-absorbing boron in an attempt to cool the nuclear fuel rods and avoid a complete meltdown. The problem that occurred is the pressure difference caused the pump systems to react and vent to depressurise the reactor vessels, causing the fuel rods to overheat but not a meltdown. This produces a water-zirconium reaction that liberates hydrogen. The zirconium of the zircaloy cladding of the fuel rods to oxidize with the resulting steam according to the reaction.</p>
					<p>Zr + 2H20 <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> ZrO2 + 2H2</p>
					<p>The hydrogen is highly explosive and a detonation is easily caused when mixed with air at high pressure. </p>
					<p>Given a hypothetical scenario would 10 per cent of the world's energy supply worth a devastating disaster every 30 years the short answer is no. We are already experiencing a limit of resources in the world, limiting ourselves by putting energy as a priority would eventually lead to humanity's downfall.</p>
					<p>Would New Zealands energy problems be worth another Fukushima or Chernobyl say in the next 10 years?</p>

					<h5 class="w3-center"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Nuclear Waste and Pollution</span></h5><!--Sub Headings-->
					<p>Spent nuclear fuel is not only radioactive but also contains extremely poisonous chemical elements like plutonium.</p>
					<p>Plutonium-239, the isotope found in the spent MOX fuel is much more radioactive than depleted uranium-238 fuel. Plutonium emits alpha radiation, a highly ionising particle of radiation. When alpha-emitters such as plutonium-239 emit this alpha radiation it can penetrate living cells, this is extremely hazardous as it can destroy or mutate these cells.</p>
					<p>Plutonium only loses its harmfulness only slowly over several tens of thousands of years. On the other hand, there is also a process called reprocessing which means the extraction of plutonium from spent nuclear fuel. </p>
					<p>The reprocessing of plutonium can be used for two purposes: to build nuclear weapons or in the use of new fuel, but hardly any of it is used as fuel. Because we don't have the right kind of reactors for that, a milligram will kill you and a few kilograms will make an atomic bomb. Even an inconspicuous country like Germany very similar to New Zealand has tons of the stuff just lying around because reprocessing sounded like the humanitarian way.</p>
					<p>So where will all the waste go? after dumping it into the ocean was forbidden countries tried to bury it, but couldn't find a place where it will stay secure for tens of thousands of years over 30 countries operate nearly 400 reactors managing several hundred thousands of tons of nuclear waste and only one is currently serious about opening permanent civilian waste repository Finland, this is an attribute to the difficultly of this matter.</p>

					<h5 class="w3-center"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">"Should New Zealnd stay Nuclear-free"</span></h5><!--Sub Headings-->
					<p>The research into the topic of "nuclear energy" I have done is very limited, it made me come to the conclusion that, yes, one day New Zealand and the world will grow to a point where redundant systems (e.g. coal/fossil fuel plants and the current nuclear systems) will be updated for the new age, a growing population and increased energy consumption. And that my knowledge is not enough to form any kind of legitimate debate on the subject "Should New Zealand stay Nuclear-Free."</p>
					<p>Aristotle famously wrote, "The more you know, the more you realize you don't know."</p>
					<p>But in my fragmented opinion, my research has led me to believe that, no, currently New Zealand has no need for the use of nuclear energy. In fact, if we did get a nuclear reactor now it will most certainly be detrimental for both our economy and our way of life. I will further explain the two detrimental facts I have brought up:</p>
					<p>Firstly, as you may have seen in the post-Covid recession a broken economy leads to a broken country. New Zealand has created a green image this not only leads to our tourism sector being increasingly more abundant but also makes our products premium, "The majority of ANZCO's finest beef is grass-fed, due to our country's extensive pastures and favourable climate - factors that set us apart on the world stage." ANZCO Foods. Using nuclear energy will only ruin this image creating a recession many times greater than Covids.</p> 
					<p>Secondly again "Nuclear Proliferation", yes, the non-proliferation act exists but it's more like a soft law than anything else and everyone knows it. So giving New Zealand nuclear energy via a nuclear reactor will only cause the world's superpowers to become suspicious of us, making the need for a greater military power more prevalent, altering our way of life.</p> 
					<p>Finally, in my opinion, New Zealand should stay nuclear-free.</p>
